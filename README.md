## Description

Nevu is a complete redesign of Plex's UI using the Plex media server's API. It comes with its own web server. It is currently only developed for desktops and laptops. It is not optimized for mobile or TV use.

Nevu currently supports Movie and TV Show libraries. You can also play media via the interface.

Mind that this project is still in development and may be unstable.

## Features
- Modern, immersive UI
- Seamless Plex integration
- Play media
- Automatic track matching (Keep the same audio and subtitle language across episodes)
- Browse libraries
- Search for media
- Watch Together (Nevu Sync)
- Get Recommendations
- Fully integrated Watchlist
- Simple and easy to use
- Pro-User features (like special shortcuts etc.)

## Installation

### Docker

The easiest way to run Nevu is to use Docker. You can use the following command to run Nevu in a Docker container:

```bash
docker volume create nevu_data
docker run --name nevu -p 3000:3000 -p 44201:44201/udp -v nevu_data:/data -e PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400 ipmake/nevu
```

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run Nevu. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  nevu:
    image: ipmake/nevu
    container_name: nevu
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "44201:44201/udp"
    volumes:
      - nevu_data:/data
    environment:
      - PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400

volumes:
  nevu_data:
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome for any feature or a bug fix. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Building Standalone Binary

You can compile the frontend directly into the Go binary to create a single, self-contained executable:

```bash
# Using Make
make build

# Or using pnpm
pnpm run build
```

The resulting standalone binary will be generated at `bin/nevu`.

Run it directly with:

```bash
PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400 ./bin/nevu
```

## Development

To develop you need 2 terminals for the frontend and backend of Nevu:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Frontend)
pnpm --dir frontend start

# Terminal 2 (Backend)
cd backend
PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400 go run .
```

You can also use Make targets:
- `make dev-frontend`
- `make dev-backend`
- `make test`
